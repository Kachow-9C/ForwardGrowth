 NOTES FOR GITHUB:


 Github Repo Format:

 master (origin)
 	|
 	+--- feature_1::initials
 	|
 	+--- feature_2::initials
 	.
 	.
 	.
 	+--- feature_3::initials


 IMPORTANT:
 	1. Make a new branch for feature you are working on and name it <feature_name>::<your_initials>
 		- Start off with a working code base connected to DB and delpoyed on master branch
 		- Don't work on files in the initial master branch but modularize and build features in seperate files (makes merging easier)

 	2. Make sure you are working on the right branch
 		- To see which brank you are on 				: git status
 		- To switch to another branch 					: git checkout <branch_name>
 		- To add a new branch 							: git branch <new_branch_name>
 		- Shorthand to add a branch and switch to it 	: git checkout -n <new_branch_name>

 	3. Try not to make any branches off the feature branches just so we can keep it simple

 	4. If you want your own copy of the repo (for personal/testing/etc use) make a personal copy of it by following these steps
 		- Clone the repository and enter directory				: git clone <repo_url> && cd ./<repo_name>
 		- Make a new repo w/ same <repo_name> on your account	
 		- Add a remote connection to your account				: git remote add personal <link_to__new_repo_on_your_account>
 		- Push to master on your account 						: git push personal   (personal is the name of your remote repo)
 		- Done. Should work like normal.
 		- If you want to add a certain branch on your repo		: git checkout <branch_name> 
 																: git add .
 																: git commit -m 'adding <branch_name> to personal'
 																: git push personal <branch_name>
